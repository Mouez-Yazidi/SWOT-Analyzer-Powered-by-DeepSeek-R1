### Ideal For

*   **Job Seekers**: Align your skills with market demands.
    
*   **Recruiters**: Precisely identify and bridge talent gaps.
    

### Key Features

*   **Advanced Reasoning**: Utilizes DeepSeek R1's state-of-the-art reasoning capabilities for in-depth analysis.
    
*   **Actionable Insights**: Provides strategic recommendations for growth and improvement.
    
*   **Efficiency & Precision**: Streamlines decision-making, saving time and reducing bias.

### Technical architecture
![Example Image](techical_architecture.png)
The system is built using **Streamlit** as the user interface, where users **upload a resume file( pdf or doc format)** and **manually input the job description**.  

Once the input is received, the system **parses the resume file** using **MarkItDown** (*a Python tool from Microsoft for converting files and office documents to Markdown*) for structured extraction.  

The parsed information, along with the job description, is then passed to the **deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b model** from groqcloud, which acts as the reasoning engine to analyze the content and generate a **SWOT analysis**. The model identifies:  

- **Strengths** based on skills and experience  
- **Weaknesses** in missing qualifications  
- **Opportunities** in aligning competencies with job trends  
- **Threats** in skill gaps or competition  

The results are then processed and displayed back in the **Streamlit app**, providing users with **actionable insights** to improve their resume alignment with job requirements.  

This system seamlessly integrates **resume parsing, job description analysis, and AI-driven reasoning** to offer a **comprehensive SWOT evaluation** for career enhancement.

How It Works
------------

1.  **Upload**: Submit your **CV** and **Job Description**.
    
2.  **Analyze**: Our advanced AI compares your skills and experience with job requirements.
    
3.  **Result**: A comprehensive **SWOT Analysis** pinpointing key strengths and areas for improvement.
